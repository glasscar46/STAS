    A class for loading and processing datasets from either JSON or CSV formats.

    The `DatasetLoader` class is responsible for loading data from a specified file (either JSON or CSV),
    parsing the data, and converting it into instances of the provided sample class (`ISample`). Optionally,
    it can handle annotated data by marking the samples as validated.

    Attributes:
        file_path (str): Path to the dataset file (JSON or CSV).
        raw_data (list): Raw data loaded from the file before conversion.
        sample_class (Type[ISample]): The class used to deserialize the data into sample objects.
        dataset (list): The list of sample objects after deserialization.
        annotated (bool): Flag indicating whether the dataset contains annotated data (default: False).
