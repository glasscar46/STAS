    Base class for objects that support serialization and deserialization.

    This class provides methods to convert an object into a dictionary 
    (serialization) and to reconstruct an object from a dictionary (deserialization).
    Any class that inherits from `Serializable` will automatically gain the ability 
    to serialize and deserialize its instances.
